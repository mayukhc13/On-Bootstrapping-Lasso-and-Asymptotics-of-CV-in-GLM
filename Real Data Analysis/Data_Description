## Load the excel file named dataR2.xlsx attached in this folder first while reproduce the codes.

## The number of observations n is 116.
The response variable is binary. In original data set by 1, denote "healthy control(or absence) and by 2, denote "patients(or presence of cancer)". For ease of notations, we adjusted 1 and 2 respectively by 0 and 1 in the simulation.

## The 9 predictive factors are : {Age, BMI, Glucose, Insulin, HOMA, Leptin, Adiponectin, Resistin, MCP.1}

## Choose B=150, a_n=n^(-1/3) and K=10

## We applied our proposed method to get important factors that involve in detection of Breast Cancer.
Here we obtain Lasso estimate of all these 9 factors and 90% Simultaneous Bootstrap Percentile Intervals.

## Finally based on these intervals and lasso estimates, we capture the important factors weighing to the presence of Breast Cancer.
This coincides with the findings of Patricio et al.(2018).
