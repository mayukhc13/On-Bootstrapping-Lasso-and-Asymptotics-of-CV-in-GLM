we will investigate the convergence behaviour of the distribution of $n^{-1/2}\hat{\lambda}_{n,K}$.

We present the histogram of the distribution of $n^{-1/2}\hat{\lambda}_{n,K}$ under the following choices: 

$n\in \{50,100,150,300,500,1000,1500,2500\}$
and
$(p,p_0)\in \{(5,2),(7,4),(8,3)\}.$

The simulation results presented here are for logistic regression. 

Similar results can be replicated for linear and gamma regressions. 

The remaining set-ups are more or less similar to what we have done so far.
